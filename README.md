# Machine Learning algorithms performance comparison

Compared performance of 12 different Machine Learning algorithms on `Iris Dataset`

Below is list of classifiers used for comparison in this assignment.

```
1) Decision Trees
2) Perceptron
3) Neural Net
4) Deep Learning
5) SVM
6) Naïve Bayes
7) Logistic Regression
8) k-Nearest Neighbors
9) Bagging
10) Random Forests
11) AdaBoost
12) Gradient Boosting
```

Most of classifiers are implemented using Python’s Scikit-Learn, except Deep learning which was implemented
using Tensor flow package.

Anaconda’s Spyder IDE was used for development of code and execution

Data set used: Iris Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

Code is developed using Python 3.6
Packages used: Scikit-Learn, Tensor Flow

Requirements:

```
1. Python version 3 or higher (Anaconda distribution recommended)
2. Install Tensor flow pakage
```

Python script name: `iris_classifier.py`

Below are results
